# My Android 14 Learning Journey üöÄ

Welcome! This repository is my personal lab for teaching myself modern Android development with a focus on **Android 14 (API 34)**. It serves as a living journal of my progress, containing a collection of small, focused projects.

## About This Repository

The goal of this project isn't to build one large application, but to create a series of independent mini-apps. Each one is designed to help me learn and practice a specific concept, component, or library within the Android ecosystem.

This is my way of tracking progress, solidifying my knowledge, and building a portfolio of my skills as they grow.

## üèóÔ∏è Project Structure

This is a multi-module Android Studio project. Instead of creating a new project for every exercise, I've organized my work as follows:

* **`DevMasterclass` (Root):** The main project container.
* **`Day1Project`, `Day2Project`, etc.:** Each of these is a completely independent and runnable **Android Application Module**.

This approach keeps everything neatly organized in one place while ensuring that each daily project is isolated and self-contained.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Concepts

I'll be exploring and implementing a variety of modern Android development technologies, including:

* **Language:** **Kotlin**
* **UI:** **Jetpack Compose** for building modern, declarative UIs.
* **Architecture:** **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)**
* **Asynchronous Programming:** **Kotlin Coroutines & Flows**
* **Jetpack Libraries:** ViewModel, Navigation, Room, LiveData/StateFlow, and others.
* **Target API:** **Android 14 (API 34)**

## How to Explore

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the entire root folder (`DevMasterclass`) in Android Studio.
3.  To run a specific project, select the desired module (e.g., `Day2Project`) from the **run configurations dropdown** in the top toolbar and click the 'Run' button.
